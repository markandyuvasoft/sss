## üìã API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | `/api/payments/create-link` | Generate payment link | API Key + JWT |
| GET | `/api/payments/:orderId` | Get payment details | API Key + JWT |
| GET | `/api/payments/user/history` | Get user payment history | API Key + JWT |
| POST | `/api/payments/webhook` | Process Cashfree webhook | None |
| POST | `/api/payments/:orderId/refund` | Refund payment | API Key + JWT |
| GET | `/api/payments/stats` | Get payment statistics | API Key + JWT (Admin) |

## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Add your Cashfree credentials
CASHFREE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

### 2. **Cashfree Dashboard Configuration**
- Generate API keys in Cashfree merchant dashboard
- Configure webhook URL: `https://your-backend-domain.com/api/payments/webhook`
- Set webhook secret for signature verification

### 3. **Testing**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run test script (update with real credentials)
node test-payment.js
```

### 4. **Database Migration**
- The Payment model will be automatically created when the app starts
- No manual migration required

## üîç Testing Checklist

- [ ] Payment link generation works
- [ ] Webhook processing updates payment status
- [ ] Payment history retrieval works
- [ ] Refund functionality works
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Security measures are effective

## üìä Monitoring

- All payment operations are logged
- Webhook processing is monitored
- Failed payments are tracked
- Payment analytics available via `/api/payments/stats`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: All endpoints require valid API key
2. **JWT Authorization**: User-specific operations require valid JWT
3. **Webhook Verification**: Optional signature verification for webhooks
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
5. **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in errors

## üí° Future Enhancements
